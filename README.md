# Social Network - NoSQL

  ## Description 
  We have previously worked with relational databases such as mySQL, so the objective of this project was to build the back end of a social networking site using the non-relational database MongoDB and the Mongoose NPM package, which uses Object Document Mapping as opposed ti Object Relational Mapping.
